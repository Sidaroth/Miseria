Miseria
===========

This game was made in ~48 hours for Global Game Jam at Hamar 2013. 

It's a web-based, plugin-free game based around the theme (Sound of a heart beating)


The game started out with the idea of the "ground" moving because of a heartbeat, towards the end the design changed away from the original theme and ended up being more earthquake centered.
